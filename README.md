## Setup

### Standard Configuration for Most Clients

This configuration works for most MCP clients:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"@ui5/mcp-server": {
			"type": "stdio",
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"@ui5/mcp-server"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Configuration

The UI5 MCP server can be configured using the following environment variables. It does not accept any command-line arguments.

**Custom Configuration Example:**

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"@ui5/mcp-server": {
			"type": "stdio",
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"@ui5/mcp-server"
			],
			"env": {
				"UI5_MCP_SERVER_ALLOWED_ODATA_DOMAINS": "localhost, services.odata.org",
				"UI5_LOG_LVL": "verbose",
				"UI5_DATA_DIR": "/change-me/to/some/other/path",
			}
		}
	}
}
```

**Configuration Options:**

* **`UI5_MCP_SERVER_ALLOWED_ODATA_DOMAINS`**:
	* Default Value: `localhost, services.odata.org`
	* Description: A comma-separated list of domains that are allowed to be used in the `oDataV4Url` parameter of the `create_ui5_app` tool, for example: `localhost, example.com, sub.example.com`. Set to an empty string to allow any domains.  
	For wildcard subdomains, prefix the domain with a dot: `.example.com`. This will match `www.example.com` but not `example.com`.
* **`UI5_MCP_SERVER_RESPONSE_NO_STRUCTURED_CONTENT`**:
	* Description: Set to any value to disable structured content in the MCP server responses.
* **`UI5_MCP_SERVER_RESPONSE_NO_RESOURCES`**:
	* Description: Set to any value to disable [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources) in the MCP server responses. This is useful for [clients that do not support resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients), such as Cursor or the Gemini CLI.
* **`UI5_LOG_LVL`**:
	* Default Value: `info`
	* Description: Internal [log level](https://ui5.github.io/cli/stable/pages/Troubleshooting/#changing-the-log-level): `silent`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `perf`, `verbose`, `silly`
* **`UI5_DATA_DIR`**:
	* Default Value: The `.ui5` directory in the user's home directory
	* Description: Directory where the MCP server stores its data, such as cached API references
